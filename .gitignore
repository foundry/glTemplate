# .gitignore file for Xcode4 / OS X Source projects
#
# Version 2.1
# For latest version, see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/49478/git-ignore-file-for-xcode-projects
#
# 2013 updates:
# - fixed the broken "save personal Schemes"
# - added line-by-line explanations for EVERYTHING (some were missing)
#
# NB: if you are storing "built" products, this WILL NOT WORK,
# and you should use a different .gitignore (or none at all)
# This file is for SOURCE projects, where there are many extra
# files that we want to exclude

# Xcode private settings (window sizes, bookmarks, breakpoints, custom executables, smart groups)
#
# This is complicated:
#
# SOMETIMES you need to put this file in version control.
# Apple designed it poorly - if you use "custom executables", they are
#  saved in this file.
# 99% of projects do NOT use those, so they do NOT want to version control this file.
#  ..but if you're in the 1%, comment out the line "*.pbxuser"

# the following section, whilst informative, does not work

# 	####  this is Adam's latest explanation, but see my version below
# 	# Xcode 4 - semi-personal settings
# 	#
# 	#
# 	# OPTION 1: ---------------------------------
# 	#     throw away ALL personal settings (including custom schemes!
# 	#     - unless they are "shared")
# 	#
# 	# NB: this is exclusive with OPTION 2 below
# 	xcuserdata
# 	
# 	# OPTION 2: ---------------------------------
# 	#     get rid of ALL personal settings, but KEEP SOME OF THEM
# 	#     - NB: you must manually uncomment the bits you want to keep
# 	#
# 	# NB: this is exclusive with OPTION 1 above
# 	#
# 	#xcuserdata/**/*
# 	
# 	#     (requires option 2 above): Personal Schemes
# 	#
# 	#!xcuserdata/**/xcschemes/*

#
#
# ####
# # XCode 4 workspaces - more detailed
# #
# # Workspaces are important! They are a core feature of Xcode - don't exclude them :)
# #
# # Workspace layout is quite spammy. For reference:
# #
# # (root)/
# # (project-name).xcodeproj/
# # 	project.pbxproj <-- this file is causing problems/getting corrupted
# # 	project.xcworkspace/
# # 			contents.xcworkspacedata
# #             xcshareddata/ <-if included, should be under source control (shared data)
# # 			xcuserdata/   <-should NOT be under source control (personal data)
# # 				(your name).xcuserdatad/
# # 						UserInterfaceState.xcuserstate  <-we don't want this
# #                          WorkspaceSettings.xcsettings   <-we don't want this
# # 	xcuserdata/
# # 		(your name).xcuserdatad/
# #                        xcdebugger/                   <-we don't want this
# #  							Breakpoints.xcbkptlist   <-we don't want this
# #  					   xcschemes/                    <-keep??
# #  					   		(project-name).xcscheme  <-keep????
# #  					   		xcschememanagement.plist <-keep????
# # 	xcdebugger/  <-we don't want this
# # 	xcschemes/   <-keep????
# #
# #
# #
# # Xcode 4 workspaces - SHARED
# #
# # This is UNDOCUMENTED (google: "developer.apple.com xcshareddata" - 0 results
# # But if you're going to kill personal workspaces, at least keep the shared ones...
# #
# #
# !xcshareddata
#
#
# ####
# # XCode 4 build-schemes
# #
# # PRIVATE ones are stored inside xcuserdata
# !xcschemes


# so instead we have to
# - optionally ignore project.xcworkspace
# - specify precisely which (other) files in xcuserdata we wish to ignore
# (there may be others, I lack the knowledge!)
# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10956312/project-xcworkspace-is-this-important
# "project.xcworkspace ! is this important?"
# (conclusion - only important if coordinating shared workspaces between groups)

# OPTION 1
# project.xcworkspace

# OPTION 2 - keep shared workspaces
project.xcworkspace/xcuserdata/

# if project.xcworkspace is not ignored, you will want to ignore this file

UserInterfaceState.xcuserstate

# and in either case this

xcdebugger/

# Xcode 4 - Deprecated classes
#
# Allegedly, if you manually "deprecate" your classes, they get moved here.
#
# We're using source-control, so this is a "feature" that we do not want!

# UNKNOWN: recommended by others, but I can't discover what these files are
#
# ...none. Everything is now explained.
