glTemplate
==========

glTemplate - cross-platform template for openGL (Windows and OSX)

This is a starter template for openGL that will compile in XCode (for OSX) and in Visual Studio  (for Windows).  

The aim is to facilitate working in platform-neutral C++/openGL without worrying unduly about the environment. 

A linux setup is to follow if I have the time.

Code adapted from Greg Slabaugh's 2014 Computer Graphics module at City University, London.

OSX additionally requires _at least_:    
- [Open Asset Import Library](http://assimp.org), libassimp   
- [glm maths library](https://www.opengl.org/sdk/libs/GLM/) 


These can be most easiy installed using the [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) package manager.

Most recently tested IDEs:  
VS 2012 / Windows 8  
XCode 7.2 / OSX 10.10
