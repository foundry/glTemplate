glTemplate
==========

glTemplate - cross-platform template for openGL (Windows and OSX)

This is a starter template for openGL that will compile in XCode (for OSX) and in Visual Studio 2012 (for Windows)

The aim is to facilitate working in platform-neutral C++/openGL without worrying unduly about the environment. 

A linux setup is to follow if I have the time.

Code adapted from Greg Slabaugh's 2014 Computer Graphics classes at City University, London.

OSX additional requirements:  
Open Asset Import Library, libassimp (this can be installed using Homebrew)
glm maths library (also via Homebrew)

and possibly others -
